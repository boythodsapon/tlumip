# SWIM-TLUMIP
This is the model repository for the Oregon Statewide Integrated land
use/transport model (SWIM).

This is the full and complete model software, but the model network is not
included and therefore official model runs cannot be completed. To access
these files, please see ODOT staff.

## User's Guide
The complete user's guide is on the [project wiki](https://github.com/pbsag/tlumip/wiki).
